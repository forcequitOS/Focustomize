### How does this work?

By modifying ~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/ModeConfigurations.json. A more detailed writeup with some more information on what exactly is modifiable will probably come along soon.

### What can it do?

25 extra Focus mode colors, any SF Symbol icon you could want under the sun*, and names way longer than Apple would have ever wanted (now featuring line breaks!)

### When?

Available as a Public Beta today! Final release date? Unknown, but if you're lucky, before the end of 2024. Open sourcing? Once the final release comes.

<sub>To my knowledge, this is the first project that actually does something this far with Focus modes, I hope you enjoy, and I hope this inspires other people to do wacky stuff like this!</sub>

<sub>* Private SF Symbols aren't supported yet, if you know of a way to easily use them on macOS, get in contact with me!</sub>
