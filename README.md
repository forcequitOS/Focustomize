### How do I install it?
```
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/forcequitOS/Focustomize/raw/main/install.sh)"
```
if you're cool...or just download the [latest release](https://github.com/forcequitOS/Focustomize/releases/latest/), extract it, copy to /Applications, ignore macOS' warnings, and run.

### How does this work?

By modifying ~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/ModeConfigurations.json. A more detailed writeup with some more information on what exactly is modifiable will probably come along soon.

### What can it do?

25 extra Focus mode colors, any SF Symbol icon you could want under the sun*, and names way longer than Apple would have ever wanted (now featuring line breaks!)

### When?

Available as a Public Beta today! Final release date? Likely in January 2025. No promises though. It'll be open-sourced the same time I make a final release.

<sub>To my knowledge, this is the first project that actually does something like this with Focus modes, I hope this inspires others to experinment a little bit too!</sub>

<sub>* The Private SF Symbol crisis has been resolved, but I have to release the public beta that actually adds support for them.</sub>
