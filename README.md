### How does this work?

By modifying ~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/ModeConfigurations.json

### What can it do?

25 extra Focus mode colors, any SF Symbol icon you could want under the sun, and names way longer than Apple would have ever wanted (now featuring line breaks!)

### When?

Available as a Public Beta today! Final release date? Unknown, but if you're lucky, before the end of 2024. Open sourcing? Once the final release comes.

### Credits.

<sub>To my knowledge, this is the first project that actually does something this far with Focus modes, I hope you enjoy, and I hope this inspires other people to do wacky stuff like this!</sub>
